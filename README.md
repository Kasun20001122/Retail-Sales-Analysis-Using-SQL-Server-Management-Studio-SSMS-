# 🚀 Retail Sales Analysis Using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Thrilled to share my latest project where I leveraged SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to analyze a retail sales dataset. From data cleaning to advanced analytics, here’s what I accomplished:

## 🔍 Key Highlights:
- ***Data Cleaning:*** Removed NULLs, formatted decimals/time columns, and optimized dataset integrity.
- ***Sales Trends:*** Compared 2022 vs. 2023 monthly sales, averages, and category performance.
- ***Customer Insights:*** Analyzed age groups, gender splits, and peak transaction times.
- ***Time-Based Queries:*** Grouped sales by Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night using SSMS’s datetime functions.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills:
- ***SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)*** for query execution, data visualization, and server management.
- ***Advanced SQL*** (CASE statements, aggregations, GROUP BY, JOIN-less pivots).
